		</br>
		<span class="reviewBy">Submitted by John Andrews, 24/06/2018</span>
		<p class="reviewBody">I bought the powertec bench and leg press to add to my home gym. After shopping
		around I settled on Emporium of Iron as their prices were the cheapest. The ordering process was quick
		and simple and I was kept up to date with the progress of my package the whole way. The equipment itself
		is very solid and sturdy, I feel very safe using it. I would definitely recommend EoI to anyone looking
		to buy gym equipment.</p>

		</br>
		<span class="reviewBy">Submitted by Terence Bogart, 17/05/2018</span>
		<p class="reviewBody">I bought a few pieces of equipment from Emporium of Iron to add to my commercial gym as
		there were starting to be too few stations for my growing customer base. The prices were good and communication
		was excellent throughout the order process. I decided to book a specific delivery slot to work around peak times
		and the timing was punctual. The delivery guys helped me to move the equipment into place and were responsive to 
		every question I had; very friendly bunch. As for the quality, my gym regulars tell me it's some of the best 
		equipment they've ever used which I was glad to hear lol. I look forward to making more orders to expand my gym.
		Thanks EoI!</p>

		<span class="reviewBy">Submitted by Gianluigi Buffon, 28/06/2018</span>
		<p class="reviewBody">Sensible prices and good quality equipment, fast delivery too. The packaging was a bit
		damaged on arrival but the actual equipment was untouched so can't really fault it. Would definitely buy again.</p>
